# Gut Health Dashboard

This project presents a static dashboard summarizing research on gut health conditions like SIBO and IBS. The page is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Running Tests

Tests ensure that important elements exist in `index.html`. To run them, you need Node.js installed.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Execute the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The default test runner is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), configured to use the JSDOM environment.
